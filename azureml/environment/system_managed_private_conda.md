# Setting Up Private Conda Packages in Azure ML System-Managed Environment

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to download Conda packages, set up a local channel, and use these packages within an Azure Machine Learning (AML) system-managed environment.

## Steps

### 1. Download Conda Packages
Use the `conda` command to download the packages without installing them:
```bash
conda install --download-only -c conda-forge numpy
conda install --download-only -c conda-forge pandas
conda install --download-only -c conda-forge scikit-learn
```

### 2. Scan packages
Scan packages on vulnerabilities using our own package scanner

### 3. Create a Local Directory for Packages
Create a directory to store the downloaded packages:

```bash
mkdir local_channel
```

### 4. Move Packages to the Local Directory
Locate the downloaded packages in the Conda cache and move them to your local directory:

```bash
mv ~/miniconda3/pkgs/numpy-*.tar.bz2 local_channel/
mv ~/miniconda3/pkgs/pandas-*.tar.bz2 local_channel/
mv ~/miniconda3/pkgs/scikit-learn-*.tar.bz2 local_channel/
```

### 5. Upload Packages to Private Channel
Use your private channel's API or command-line tools to upload the packages. Replace your_private_channel_upload_command with the actual command provided by your private channel. Hereâ€™s a generic example:

```bash
for package in local_channel/*.tar.bz2; do
    your_private_channel_upload_command --file $package --username YOUR_USERNAME --password YOUR_PASSWORD
done
```

### 6. Index the Local Directory
Use the conda index command to create a package index for your local directory:

```bash
conda index local_channel
```

### 7. Create a Conda Environment YAML File
Create an environment YAML file (environment.yml) that specifies your local channel and the packages to be installed:

```yaml
name: my_env
channels:
  - https://username:password@my_private_channel.com/
dependencies:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
```

### 8. Create the Environment in Azure ML
Use the Azure ML Python SDK to create and register the environment using the YAML file. Ensure that your private channel is accessible:

```python
from azureml.core import Environment
from azureml.core.conda_dependencies import CondaDependencies

# Define the environment
env = Environment(name='my_env')
env.python.conda_dependencies = CondaDependencies.from_file('environment.yml')

# Register the environment
workspace = 'your_workspace'  # Replace with your workspace
env.register(workspace=workspace)
```

### 9 Ensure Compute Target Access
Ensure that the compute target has access to the private channel where the packages are stored.

### 10. Use the Environment in Your Training or Inference Script
When you submit your training or inference job, specify the registered environment:

```python
from azureml.core import Experiment
from azureml.core.runconfig import RunConfig

# Create an experiment
workspace = 'your_workspace'  # Replace with your workspace
experiment = Experiment(workspace=workspace, name='my_experiment')

# Configure the run
env = Environment.get(workspace=workspace, name='my_env')
run_config = RunConfig(environment=env)

# Submit the run
run = experiment.submit(config=run_config)
```

### 11. Summary
By following these steps, you can download Conda packages, set up a local channel, and use these packages within an Azure ML system-managed environment. This ensures that the packages are installed from your local channel without fetching them online.
